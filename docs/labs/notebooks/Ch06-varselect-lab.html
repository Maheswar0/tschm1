<p>First of all, we note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Salary</span></code> variable is missing for
some of the players.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.isnan()</span></code>  function can be used to

<p>We first choose the best model using forward selection based on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_p\)</span> (6.2). This score

<h3>Choosing Among Models Using the Validation Set Approach and Cross-Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-among-models-using-the-validation-set-approach-and-cross-validation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As an  alternative to using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_p\)</span>, we might try cross-validation to select a model in forward selection. For this, we need a
method that stores the full path of models found in forward selection, and allows predictions for each of these. This can be done with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn_selection_path()</span></code>
estimator from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ISLP.models</span></code>. The function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cross_val_predict()</span></code> from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ISLP.models</span></code>
computes the cross-validated predictions for each of the models
along the path, which we can use to evaluate the cross-validated MSE
along the path.</p>
<p>Here we define a strategy that fits the full forward selection path.
While there are various parameter choices for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn_selection_path()</span></code>,
we use the defaults here, which selects the model at each step based on the biggest reduction  in RSS.</p>

<p>This gives us an array of fitted values — 20 steps in all, including the fitted mean for the null model — which we can use to evaluate
in-sample MSE. As expected, the in-sample MSE improves each step we take,
indicating we must use either the validation or cross-validation
approach to select the number of steps. We fix the y-axis to range from
50,000 to 250,000 to compare to the cross-validation and validation
set MSE below, as well as other methods such as ridge regression, lasso and
principal components regression.</p>

<p>Notice the expression <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Y[:,None]</span></code> above.
This adds an axis (dimension) to the one-dimensional array <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Y</span></code>,
which allows it to be recycled when subtracted from the two-dimensional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Yhat_in</span></code>.</p>
<p>We are now ready to use cross-validation to estimate test error along
the model path. We must use <em>only the training observations</em> to perform all aspects of model-fitting — including
variable selection.  Therefore, the determination of which model of a
given size is best must be made using \emph{only the training
observations} in each training fold. This point is subtle but important.  If the full data
set is used to select the best subset at each step, then the validation
set errors and cross-validation errors that we obtain will not be
accurate estimates of the test error.</p>
<p>We now compute the cross-validated predicted values using 5-fold cross-validation.</p>

<p>The prediction matrix <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Yhat_cv</span></code> is the same shape as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Yhat_in</span></code>; the difference is that the predictions in each row, corresponding to a particular sample index, were made from models fit on a training fold that did not include that row.</p>
<p>At each model along the path, we compute the MSE in each of the cross-validation folds.
These we will average to get the  mean MSE, and can also use the individual values to compute a crude estimate of the standard error of the mean. {The estimate is crude because the five error estimates  are based on overlapping training sets, and hence are not independent.}
Hence we must know the test indices for each cross-validation
split. This can be found by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">split()</span></code> method of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kfold</span></code>. Because
we  fixed the random state above, whenever we split any array with the same
number of rows as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span> we recover the same training and test indices, though we simply
ignore the training indices below.</p>

<h3>Best Subset Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#best-subset-selection" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Forward stepwise is a <em>greedy</em> selection procedure; at each step it augments the current set by including one additional variable.  We now apply best subset selection  to the  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hitters</span></code>
data, which for every subset size, searches for the best set of predictors.</p>
<p>We will use a package called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l0bnb</span></code> to perform
best subset selection.
Instead of constraining the subset to be a given size,
this package produces a path of solutions using the subset size as a
penalty rather than a constraint. Although the distinction is subtle, the difference comes when we cross-validate.</p>

We start with the model matrix <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X</span></code> (without an intercept) that we computed in the previous section on best subset regression.</p>
<section id="ridge-regression">
<h3>Ridge Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#ridge-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We will use the function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skl.ElasticNet()</span></code> to fit both  ridge and the lasso.
To fit a <em>path</em> of ridge regressions models, we use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skl.ElasticNet.path()</span></code>, which can fit both ridge and lasso, as well as a hybrid mixture;  ridge regression
corresponds to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l1_ratio=0</span></code>.
It is good practice to standardize the columns of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X</span></code> in these applications, if the variables are measured in different units. Since <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skl.ElasticNet()</span></code> does no normalization, we have to take care of that ourselves.
Since we
standardize first, in order to find coefficient
estimates on the original scale, we must <em>unstandardize</em>
the coefficient estimates. The parameter
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> in (6.5) and (6.7) is called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alphas</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code>. In order to
be consistent with the rest of this chapter, we use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lambdas</span></code>
rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alphas</span></code> in what follows.  {At the time of publication, ridge fits like the one in code chunk [22] issue unwarranted convergence warning messages; we expect these to disappear as this package matures.}</p>

<p>Here we extract the array of coefficients corresponding to the solutions along the regularization path.
By default the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skl.ElasticNet.path</span></code> method fits a path along
an automatically selected range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> values, except for the case when
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l1_ratio=0</span></code>, which results in ridge regression (as is the case here). {The reason is rather technical; for all models except ridge, we can find the smallest value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> for which all coefficients are zero. For ridge this value is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\infty\)</span>.}  So here
we have chosen to implement the function over a grid of values ranging
from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda=10^{8}\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda=10^{-2}\)</span> scaled by the standard
deviation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>, essentially covering the full range of scenarios
from the null model containing only the intercept, to the least
squares fit.</p>
<p>Associated with each value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is a vector of ridge
regression coefficients,   that can be accessed by
a column of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">soln_array</span></code>. In this case, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">soln_array</span></code> is a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(19 \times 100\)</span> matrix, with
19 rows (one for each predictor) and 100
columns (one for each value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>).</p>
<p>We transpose this matrix and turn it into a data frame to facilitate viewing and plotting.</p>

<p>(We have used <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">latex</span></code> formatting in the horizontal label, in order to format the Greek <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> appropriately.)
We expect the coefficient estimates to be much smaller, in terms of

when a small value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is used. (Recall that the  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ell_2\)</span> norm is the square root of the sum of squared coefficient values.) We display  the coefficients at the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40\)</span>th step,

<p>Choosing an <em>a priori</em> value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> for ridge regression is
difficult if not impossible. We will want to use the validation method
or cross-validation to select the tuning parameter. The reader may not
be surprised that the  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipeline()</span></code> approach can be used in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skm.cross_validate()</span></code> with either a validation method
(i.e. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">validation</span></code>) or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-fold cross-validation.</p>
<p>We fix the random state of the splitter
so that the results obtained will be reproducible.</p>

<p>The test MSE is 1.342e+05.  Note
that if we had instead simply fit a model with just an intercept, we
would have predicted each test observation using the mean of the
training observations. We can get the same result by fitting a ridge regression model
with a <em>very</em> large value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>. Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1e10</span></code>

<h3>Fast Cross-Validation for Solution Paths<a class="headerlink" href="#fast-cross-validation-for-solution-paths" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The ridge, lasso, and elastic net can be efficiently fit along a sequence of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> values, creating what is known as a <em>solution path</em> or <em>regularization path</em>. Hence there is specialized code to fit
such paths, and to choose a suitable value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> using cross-validation. Even with
identical splits the results will not agree <em>exactly</em> with our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grid</span></code>
above because the standardization of each feature  in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grid</span></code> is carried out on each fold,
while in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pipeCV</span></code> below it is carried out only once.
Nevertheless, the results are similar as the normalization
is relatively stable across folds.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Test Error of Cross-Validated Ridge<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluating-test-error-of-cross-validated-ridge" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Choosing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> using cross-validation provides a single regression
estimator, similar to fitting a linear regression model as we saw in
Chapter 3. It is therefore reasonable to estimate what its test error
is. We run into a problem here in that cross-validation will have
<em>touched</em> all of its data in choosing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>, hence we have no
further data to estimate test error. A compromise is to do an initial
split of the data into two disjoint sets: a training set and a test set.
We then fit a cross-validation
tuned ridge regression on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set.
We might call this cross-validation nested
within the validation set approach. A priori there is no reason to use
half of the data for each of the two sets in validation. Below, we use
75% for training and 25% for test, with the estimator being ridge
regression tuned using 5-fold cross-validation.  This can be achieved
in code as follows:</p>

<h3>The Lasso<a class="headerlink" href="#the-lasso" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We saw that ridge regression with a wise choice of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> can
outperform least squares as well as the null model on the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hitters</span></code>  data set. We now ask whether the lasso can yield
either a more accurate or a more interpretable model than ridge
regression. In order to fit a lasso model, we once again use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ElasticNetCV()</span></code>  function; however, this time we use the argument
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">l1_ratio=1</span></code>. Other than that change, we proceed just as we did in
fitting a ridge model.</p>

<p>However, the lasso has a substantial advantage over ridge regression
in that the resulting coefficient estimates are sparse. Here we see
that 6 of the 19 coefficient estimates are exactly zero. So the lasso
model with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> chosen by cross-validation contains only 13
variables.</p>

<p>As in ridge regression, we could evaluate the test error
of cross-validated lasso by first splitting into
test and training sets and internally running
cross-validation on the training set. We leave
this as an exercise.</p>

<p>Principal components regression (PCR) can be performed using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PCA()</span></code>  from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn.decomposition</span></code>
module. We now apply PCR to the  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hitters</span></code>  data, in order to
predict <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Salary</span></code>. Again, ensure that the missing values have
been removed from the data, as described in Section 6.5.1.</p>
<p>We use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LinearRegression()</span></code>  to fit the regression model
here. Note that it fits an intercept by default, unlike
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OLS()</span></code> function seen earlier in Section 6.5.1.</p>

<p>We see that the smallest cross-validation error occurs when
17
components are used. However, from the plot we also see that the
cross-validation error is roughly the same when only one component is
included in the model. This suggests that a model that uses just a
small number of components might suffice.</p>
<p>The CV score is provided for each possible number of components from
1 to 19 inclusive. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PCA()</span></code> method complains
if we try to fit an intercept only with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n_components=0</span></code>

<p>Briefly, we can think of
this as the amount of information about the predictors
that is captured using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> principal components. For example, setting
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M=1\)</span> only captures 38.31% of the variance, while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M=2\)</span> captures an additional 21.84%, for a total of 60.15% of the variance.
By  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M=6\)</span> it increases to
